# Advent of Code 2021

These are my solutions to the 2021 Advent of Code. My solutions are written in Clojure.

# Learnings

- Cursive and Specter don't play nicely together. To properly index/analyze the Specter library, you'll need to clone
  it, open it in IDEA, and tell Cursive how to resolve its various macros. You'll definitely want to set resolutions for `defnav` and `defdynamicnav`.
